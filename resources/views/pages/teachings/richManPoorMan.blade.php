                <p>More than seventy percent (70%) of any Batangueño community is
                made up of the poorer segment of society. The inequality shows not
                only in the houses they live in and in the food they eat, but also in the
                comforts of living they enjoy and the education their children get.</p>

                <p>The poor around us live in lightly built houses, eat less rich food and
                    engage only in simple recreation. Next to the little leisure available to
                    them is the chance of playing small games of gambling. They engage
                    in these, either to while away their time or to nurture the faint hope of
                    getting lucky and winning an amount of money which their poor life
                    cannot provide them.</p>

                <p>Alas, the poor never win in gambling games. Hardly can they win in
                    any competition, for life’s chances are always ‘loaded or stacked’
                    against them. They practically have very little chance to succeed in
                    politics, in business, and in gambling, too.</p>

                <p>The quality of being differs among people depending on how well
                    provided or how much deprived they are in life. Indeed, how
                    unfortunate are the poor, that as they are dispossessed, they are also
                    oppressed. The late Pope Paul VI once said: “The scandal of glaring
                    inequalities in people’s lives is not merely in the enjoyment of
                    possessions but even more in the exercise of power.” (PP, 9)</p>

                <p>The Gospel describes the grave social inequalities of today in the
                    parable of the rich man, Dives, and the beggar, Lazarus. “There was a
                    rich man who used to dress in purple and fine linen and feast
                    magnificently every day. And at his gate, there used to lie a poor man
                    called Lazarus, covered with sores, who longed to fill himself with
                    what fell from the rich man’s table.” (Luke 16:19-22)</p>

                <p>The social inequality – so unchristian and oftentimes inhuman, too –
                    calls the attention to the Christian Batangueño. He knows that poverty
                    s not the lot and destiny of the human person. We are called to a
                    fullness of life! And fullness of life is what Jesus brought us – “I have
                    come so that they may have life and have it to the full.” (John 10:10)</p>
