                <p>Pondong Batanagn is supported by the Batangueño communities with
                    small amounts/contributions from individuals and families – young
                    and old, rich and poor. They believe in the philosophy that <b>the very
                    
                    small amount coming from many is better than a huge amount
                    that comes rarely from few.</b></p>

                <p>The big amount threatens even the rich. But the coins, the loose
                    change – left over form paying jeepney fares or from buying
                    newspaper, hardly frighten even the poor. The coins are even
                    perceived nowadays to have lost their monetary value. But these coins,
                    small as they are like crumbs, when collected make a big amount.</p>

                <p>The small amount or contribution as long as it is frequently or regularly
                    given will one day total a big amount. Frequency or regularity is a
                    force to reckon with. The constant drip of water from a leaking faucet
                    fills a pail after some time. So it is with frequent or regular donation,
                    no matter how small the amount, this will; some day be wealth.</p>

                <p>Regular contributions of small amounts for Pondong Batangan is a
                    way to storing wealth in heaven. When we give our contribution for
                    Pondong Batangan, we do not expect anything in return; we do not
                    expect our money to earn interest, for it is gratuitously given.
                    However, one thing we can be assured of: God records our small but
                    regular contributions in heaven and heaven itself is our reward.</p>
