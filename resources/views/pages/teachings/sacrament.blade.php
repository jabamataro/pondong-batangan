                <p>Our Lord expects only very small things from those he loves. The acts
                    that will lead us to heaven are incredibly small. We remember the
                    parable of the talents where the Master assured the servant: “You have
                    shown that you can be faithful in small things. I will trust you with
                    greater; come and join in your Master’s happiness.” (Matthew 25:21)</p>

                <p>God sees even the smallest expression of sincerity and fidelity. No
                    assertion of goodness – no matter how seemingly insignificant - is
                    ever lost to God. Our great God sees beyond and more than the
                    smallness of the widow’s mite. The Lord Jesus happened to notice a
                    poverty-stricken widow putting in two small coins, and he said to His
                    disciples: “I tell you truly, this widow has put in more than any of
                    them; for these have all contributed money they had over, but she
                    from the little she had, put in all she had to live on.” (Luke 21:24)</p>

                <p>The smallest gesture given in love becomes great, not because of man,
                    but only through the power of God’s own love inspiring the human
                    person’s little acts.</p>

                <p>If a smile is a sign of a person’s happiness, why cannot a cup of water
                    given to the thirsty be an image of compassion that dwells within?
                    This is the reason why the Lord said: “I was hungry, you gave me to
                    eat; I was thirsty, you gave me drink. Come enter the Kingdom
                    prepared for you.” (Matt. 25:35) A cup of water for the thirsty, given
                    in love, can guarantee heaven to the compassionate.</p>
