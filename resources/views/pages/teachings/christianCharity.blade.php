                <p>In the economy of love, the small becomes great. The little, put
                        together by the bond of love, becomes a saving bounty. The small
                        becomes the expression of God’s love for the human person. This is
                        the <b>Credo of Pondong Batangan.</b> This is the charity of the
                        Batangueño, mirroring the love of God. Within this economy of little
                        gifts and many expressions of compassion, the person images not only
                        his personal goodness, but he becomes the image of the loving God on
                        earth!</p>

                <p>Was this not the initial mind of God when he said before creating
                        human beings? “Let us make man to out image and likeness.” (Gen.
                        1:27) Human beings must truly represent God on earth. Human
                        goodness, love and compassion bring down God’s presence again on
                        our midst. Charity easily brings divine goodness in our societies.</p>

                <p>Compassion is the most acceptable ambassador of God in human

                        makes God present in human conduct and relation.</p>
