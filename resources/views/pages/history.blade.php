                <p>Year 2000 was the Great Jubilee Year in the whole Catholic Church as declared
                by Pope John Paul II. The preparation for this celebration began with the
                publication of the Apostolic Letter “Tertio Millenio Adveniente” (As the Third
                Millennium Approaches) on November 10, 1994 and its convocation was made
                through the Papal Bull “Incarnationis Mysterium” (The Mystery of the
                Incarnation) issued on November 29, 1998. In the Archdiocese of Lipa, aside
                from the prescribed ways of celebrating the Jubilee, LAGPAS III (Lipa
                Archdiocesan General Pastoral Assembly) was held on April 26 - 28, 2000 under
                the animation of the then Archbishop Gaudencio B. Rosales. It was in this
                assembly of priests and lay delegates from parishes and church organizations
                in the Archdiocese that Pondong Batangan was launched.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">An Integral Evangelization Program and a Community Foundation</h2>
                <p><b>Pondong Batangan</b> was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 8, 1999 under the
                    official name of Pondong Batangan Community Foundation, Inc. (PBCFI). It was conceived as a program of integral
                    evangelization but it also bore the features of a community foundation. While it proclaimed the “Good News of the
                    Fullness of Life” and invited the practice of Christian Charity by way of small giving among the Batangueños, it was also
                    able to build up funds for people and community development.</p>

                <p>Today, the Batangueños continue to actively support Pondong Batangan offering 25 centavos in indigenous coin banks
                    called the “PB TIBYO”. These are kept in their homes and once filled with coins or loose change, they are offered during
                    mass. Truly, Pondong Batangan “operationalizes” the love of Christ through a simple practice which also developed the
                    “Spirituality of the Crumbs”, an offshoot on the reflection on the Parable of the Rich Man and the Beggar (Luke 16: 19-
                    31).</p>

                <p>As a community foundation, Pondong Batangan gives out grants and financial assistance for various programs and
                    projects that will help uplift the lives of individuals, families, and communities in the Province of Batangas. The first
                    program implemented by the various parishes was the micro or social credit program (Alalay sa Kabuhayan ng Pondong
                    Batangan) and this spun off to other livelihood projects. A scholarship program (Dunong Batangan Scholarship Program)
                    then helped poor but deserving students get a college education from partner schools, as well as a vocational training
                    program (Galing Batangueno Vocational Training Program) which offered various courses in partnership with different
                    individual trainors and training institutions which imparted employable skills to out-of-school youth and out-of-job
                    young adults. Social Enterprise (Sipag Batangueno) also got funding support. From its “small” beginnings, Pondong
                    Batangan continued to reach out and extend a helping hand to poor and needy Batangueños.</p>
